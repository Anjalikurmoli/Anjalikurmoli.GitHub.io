Under the awesome-datascience GitHub Data sets list, the one that interested me is Public Bigdata Sets [https://hadoopilluminated.com/hadoop_illuminated/Public_Bigdata_Sets.html].
The potential applications of the Public Bigdata Sets are Pointers to datasets, Generic Repositories, Geo data, Web data and Government data.

As I started my journey on Big Data Analytics, I'm learning new fundamentals. I went through the book list on free-data-science-book GitHub, I came across the book, "An Introduction to R, Notes on R: A Programming Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics" by W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith and the R Core Team [https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf]. As I do not know R programming language, I feel that this book will guide me through. It also covers the concepts from basics which is exactly what I needed.
